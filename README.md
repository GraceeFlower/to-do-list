# To-do-list
This is a list to record your missions.  
You can do something like these:  

- add a task named "Get up at 6:00 a.m."(maybe sth. else like this~)
- select the task you have done or you want to abandon and delete it
- separate the selected & non-selected items
...

By the way,the new list item is saved in your localStorage~
Here comes the [GitHub Pages](https://graceeflower.github.io/to-do-list/)~
